# Web Part Library Management Integration

## Overview

This document describes how web parts in the Azure Accommodation Form application integrate with the External Library Admin system to ensure all library management operations use the admin-managed list exclusively.

## Implementation

### Form Integration

The main accommodation form (`app.js`) now includes a **Document Library Selection** section that:

1. **Loads libraries exclusively from the admin API** via `/api/admin/public/active-libraries`
2. **Uses the External Library Integration API** (`external-library-integration.js`) to create dynamic library selectors
3. **Prevents hardcoded library references** by requiring all library data to come from the admin system
4. **Validates library selection** as a required field before form submission

### Key Components

#### 1. Library Selector Component
- Located in Section 11 of the accommodation form
- Dynamically populated from admin-managed libraries only
- Provides real-time library information display
- Requires selection before form submission

#### 2. Admin API Integration
- Uses `/api/admin/public/active-libraries` endpoint
- Only shows active libraries to end users
- Respects library status and permissions
- Handles API errors gracefully with fallback messages

#### 3. Error Handling
- Displays warning when admin system is unavailable
- Prevents form submission when library management fails
- Provides clear error messages to users
- Logs issues for administrator review

## Validation

### Required Changes Implemented
- ✅ Main form includes external library integration script
- ✅ Library selector uses admin API exclusively 
- ✅ Form data collection includes selected library information
- ✅ No hardcoded library references remain in the codebase
- ✅ Error handling for admin system unavailability
- ✅ Library selection validation before form submission

### Test Verification
A test page (`test_library_integration.html`) is available to verify:
- External Library API availability
- Admin-managed library loading
- Selector and grid components
- Error handling behavior

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin-Only Management**: Library add/remove operations are restricted to admin users
2. **Public Read Access**: The `/api/admin/public/active-libraries` endpoint provides read-only access to active libraries
3. **Validation**: All library data is validated by the admin system before being available to web parts
4. **Audit Trail**: All library management operations are logged by the admin system

## Future Maintenance

1. **Adding New Web Parts**: Any new components requiring library selection should use `window.externalLibraryAPI.createSelector()`
2. **Library Updates**: Changes to libraries through the admin interface automatically appear in all web parts
3. **Monitoring**: Check application logs for library integration errors
4. **Fallback Handling**: Ensure proper error messages when the admin system is unavailable

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/admin/public/active-libraries` - Used by web parts to load available libraries
- `GET /api/admin/libraries` - Admin-only endpoint for library management
- `POST /api/admin/libraries` - Admin-only endpoint for creating libraries
- `PUT /api/admin/libraries/{id}` - Admin-only endpoint for updating libraries
- `DELETE /api/admin/libraries/{id}` - Admin-only endpoint for removing libraries

All web part library operations now go through these admin-managed endpoints exclusively.
