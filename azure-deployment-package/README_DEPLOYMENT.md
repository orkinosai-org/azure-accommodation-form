# Azure Accommodation Form - Easy Deployment Guide

**For Non-Technical Users - Deploy to Azure App Service Using Azure Portal Only**

This guide will help you deploy the Azure Accommodation Form application to Microsoft Azure without needing any technical knowledge, command line tools, or programming experience. You'll only use your web browser and the Azure Portal.

## üìã What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

‚úÖ **Microsoft Azure account** (create one at [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com))  
‚úÖ **Azure subscription** (free tier works fine)  
‚úÖ **Email account for SMTP** (Gmail, Outlook, or business email)  
‚úÖ **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)  
‚úÖ **This deployment package** (the ZIP file you downloaded)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create Azure Storage Account

Your application needs a place to store submitted forms securely.

1. **Open Azure Portal**
   - Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
   - Sign in with your Azure account

2. **Create Storage Account**
   - Click **"Create a resource"** (+ icon in top left)
   - Search for **"Storage account"**
   - Click **"Storage account"** then **"Create"**

3. **Configure Storage Account**
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription
   - **Resource group**: Click **"Create new"** and name it `accommodation-form-rg`
   - **Storage account name**: Choose a unique name (letters and numbers only, no spaces)
     - Example: `accommodationforms2024`
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users (e.g., East US, West Europe)
   - **Performance**: Standard
   - **Redundancy**: Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
   - Click **"Review + create"** then **"Create"**

4. **Get Storage Connection String**
   - Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
   - Click **"Go to resource"**
   - In left menu, click **"Access keys"**
   - Copy the entire **"Connection string"** from key1
   - **Save this in a text file** - you'll need it later

### Step 2: Create Azure Web App

     - Example: `my-accommodation-form-app`
     - This will be your website URL: `https://my-accommodation-form-app.azurewebsites.net`
   - **Publish**: Code
   - **Runtime stack**: Python 3.12
   - **Operating System**: Linux
   - **Region**: Same as storage account
   - **App Service Plan**: Create new
     - **Name**: `accommodation-form-plan`

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Configuration File**
   - Open `appsettings.json` in the deployment package
   - Verify all required settings have real values (not placeholders)
   - Check for typos in setting names and values

2. **Check Storage Connection**
   - Test the storage connection string in BlobStorageSettings
   - Ensure storage account is accessible

3. **Check Email Settings**
   - Verify SMTP settings in EmailSettings section
   - Test with a simple email first

#### "Email Sending Failed"
**Problem**: Form submits but no emails are sent

**Solutions**:
1. **Gmail Issues**
