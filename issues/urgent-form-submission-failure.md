# URGENT: Form submission fails & validation logic missing — restore validation and fix submission now

**Critical Issue: Form Submission Failure and Validation Missing**

- Deadline has passed, urgent fix required.
- Form submission fails in development mode with API response: `Success: False`, message: `Failed to submit form`.
- Debug output confirms all core fields (Full Name, Email, Telephone, Consent) were filled, but Consent is False and submission fails regardless of frontend success.
- Validation logic must be restored and enforced in all steps (especially Consent and critical fields) to match original requirements.
- Issue is blocking user submissions and production readiness.
